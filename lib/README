# NodeMCU as a master for controlling a Model Airplane

This code is a part of a larger project. Ideally it can be used in combination with the "Remote Controller" Android App 
to controll any remote controlled vehicle or plane or drone. 

The Remote Controller Android App uses WebSockets to communicate with an android device and receives the controller signals 
from two joysticks. 

The use of WebSockets was essential, in order to continuously send and receive the control signals without having to open/close an 
https connection using the Get & Set methods. Websockets are a way for a server and client (server and webpage) to talk to each other 
freely and either side can send data at any time (asynchronous) without being asked for it.

## A short introduction to Websockets and a comprison with HTTP protocol

In comparison to the HTTP which is what is used in most of the NodeMCU Tutorials online use, 



For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib

|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

and a contents of `src/main.c`:
```
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will find automatically dependent
libraries scanning project source files.
